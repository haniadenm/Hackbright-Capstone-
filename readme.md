# It takes a village

It takes a village is a platform designed to connect parents, children and caregivers. It is designed to take the stress out of planning a meet up. The application would make  viewing, signing up and being matched easier for userâ€™s, specific to their needs. Parents can sign up to the application and select their intent. They have the option to meet other parents with the same interests who are in their zip code. They can also connect their children with other children who are in the same age group. Once they select an activity, the application is designed to match them up with other parents/ children in their area.  My goal was to take the stress out of building relationships. 

Future plans : 
* Create a search function
* Create a chat box
* Apply google Api for location 


## Tech Stack
Python and SQLALchemy backend
Flask web framework
PostgresSQL database


## Features

* Parent can sign up
* Plan a meetup (depending on intent - parent-parent or child-child)
* View other parents profile 
* View list of activities
